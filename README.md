# ACE-dev-env-React
This is a vagrantfile to setup a virtual development environment for React/meteor development.  It was created mainly for students of the Red River College ACE Project Space.

For ease of file editing, it has been configured with a samba server file share pointed at the /home/vagrant folder.  Samba was selected due to the issues with file locks that vagrant's native shared folder feature.  Since most students use Windows in our college program, SMB was the most sensible choice.
